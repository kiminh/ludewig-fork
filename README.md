<h1>session-rec</h1>

This is a modified, updated, and slightly optimised version of https://github.com/rn5l/session-rec which also supports Python 3.5+.

All changes were made to support models created as part of https://github.com/x775/skips-recommender for the 30Music dataset.

Please refer to the original repository for a general description of the framework.
